# design_patterns-v-1
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software development problems. They are not specific to any programming language, but are commonly implemented in various languages such as JavaScript. Some examples of design patterns that are commonly used in JavaScript include:

Module Pattern: 
  This pattern allows for the creation of private    and public methods and variables, which is useful for keeping the global namespace clean and providing a clear structure for your code.

Singleton Pattern: 
  This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Observer Pattern: 
  This pattern allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects, without being tightly coupled to them. This is useful for creating event-driven systems.

Factory Pattern: 
  This pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Decorator Pattern: 
  This pattern allows you to add new behavior to existing objects dynamically, without modifying their class.
