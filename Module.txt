Module
The Module pattern is a design pattern used in JavaScript to 
emulate the concept of classes in other programming languages. 
One of the key benefits of the Module pattern is that it allows 
for the creation of private and public methods and variables, 
which helps to keep the global namespace clean and provides a 
clear structure for your code. The private methods and variables 
are only accessible within the scope of the module, and the public 
methods and variables are exposed to the rest of the application.
The Module design pattern is a way to create self-contained and 
reusable code in JavaScript. It provides a way to encapsulate data 
and behavior, and to hide implementation details from the rest of 
the application. The pattern is useful for creating code that is 
easy to understand, test, and maintain.
The Module pattern is widely used in JavaScript, it's popular in 
libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS and VueJS. 
It's also used in many large-scale JavaScript applications to 
organize the code and make it more maintainable.

Another variation of the Module pattern is 
the Revealing Module 
pattern, which is similar to the basic Module pattern but it also 
allows for the easy revelation of certain private methods and 
variables by returning an anonymous object with pointers to the 
private functionality. This variation of the pattern makes it easy 
to expose only the necessary public methods and variables, without 
revealing the entire implementation.

It's important to note that The module pattern is just one of the 
ways to organize the code, other alternatives like the ES6 module 
system and the CommonJS module system are also available and are 
widely used.
